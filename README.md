Interview "work simulation"

This exercise is designed to tell us something about your capabilities as a Java developer.
The ultimate goal of it is spelled out in the main method of src/com/proquest/interview/phonebook/PhoneBookImpl.
You will also need to know how to write a few very simple SQL queries.

The code is entirely self-contained: you should be able to load it up in Eclipse or another IDE 
and begin working immediately, without needing any other tools or libraries.

Implement the TODO comments to the best of your ability.  In addition, you should be looking at how to improve this program. 
The DatabaseUtil class should not need to be significantly refactored, although you may do so as long as you do not destroy its functionality.

You should be able to fork this project, make your changes, and send a PR.  We expect to see multiple
commits.   If the work is all in a single commit, it will be hard not to assume you copied and pasted this.
Also, we know what ChatGPT generates.   It's not good.  Don't use it for this, it will be a short conversation.

If you find a bunch of forks of this.   Beware, most of them are bad.  Feel free to review them, steal ideas, etc, but 
in general I've asked people I've hired to remove their forks, so only solutions for people I've rejected are still out there...

This exercise typically does not take long, unless you choose to do significant refactoring.  I don't have a problem with refactoring, 
but I do have a problem with you spending 12 hours on what is supposed to be a quick evaluation of your programming ability.
There are many possible approaches, and no single "right answer".  But do be prepared to discuss the changes that you made.

Thank you!
